# Rule Engine

A simple yet powerful rule engine built with Next.js and Drizzle ORM that allows users to create, combine, and evaluate rules using an intuitive user interface. The engine utilizes Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) for rule representation and manipulation, enabling complex rule evaluations.
